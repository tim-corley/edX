Start-up a local, postgres server to host a database:

Start Postgres prompt:
$ psql {database name}  --> {database name}=#

Exit Postgres prompt:
{database name}=+ \q

-- within psql prompt --

1) Create Table

week4=# CREATE TABLE flights (
week4(#   id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
week4(#   origin VARCHAR NOT NULL,
week4(#   destination VARCHAR NOT NULL,
week4(#   duration INTEGER NOT NULL
week4(# );
CREATE TABLE

week4=# \d
week4=# \l
week4=# SELECT * FROM flights;

2) Add Data

week4=# INSERT INTO flights (origin, destination, duration) VALUES ('New York', 'London', 415);
INSERT 0 1
week4=# INSERT INTO flights (origin, destination, duration) VALUES ('Shanghai', 'Paris', 760);
INSERT 0 1
week4=# INSERT INTO flights (origin, destination, duration) VALUES ('Istanbul', 'Tokyo', 700);
INSERT 0 1
week4=# INSERT INTO flights (origin, destination, duration) VALUES ('New York', 'Paris', 435);
INSERT 0 1
week4=# INSERT INTO flights (origin, destination, duration) VALUES ('Moscow', 'Paris', 415);
INSERT 0 1
week4=# INSERT INTO flights (origin, destination, duration) VALUES ('Lima', 'New York', 455);
INSERT 0 1

week4=# SELECT * FROM flights;

week4=# SELECT * FROM flights WHERE id =3;

week4=# SELECT * FROM flights WHERE origin = 'New York';

week4=# SELECT * FROM flights WHERE destination = 'Paris' AND duration > 500;

week4=# SELECT * FROM flights ORDER BY duration ASC;

3) Update / Change / Delete Data

week4=# UPDATE flights SET duration = 245 WHERE origin = 'Moscow' AND destination = 'Paris';
UPDATE 1

week4=# DELETE FROM flights WHERE destination = 'Tokyo';

4) Select (view) data from separate tables via JOIN

week4=# SELECT origin, destination, name FROM flights JOIN passengers ON passengers.flight_id = flights.id;

5) Other queries

week4=# SELECT origin, COUNT(*) FROM flights GROUP BY origin;

week4=# SELECT origin, COUNT(*) FROM flights GROUP BY origin HAVING COUNT(*) >1;

week4=# SELECT flight_id FROM passengers GROUP BY flight_id HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;

week4=# SELECT * FROM flights WHERE id IN (SELECT flight_id FROM passengers GROUP BY flight_id HAVING COUNT(*) > 1);
